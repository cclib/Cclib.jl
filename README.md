# Cclib.jl

Extented Julia bindings to [cclib](https://github.com/cclib/cclib) library.

## Features

- Parsing outputs from 16 different programs: ADF, DALTON, Firefly, GAMESS (US), GAMESS-UK, Gaussian, Jaguar, Molpro, MOLCAS, MOPAC, NWChem, ORCA, Psi4, NBO, QChem and Turbomole.

- Further analysis of calculation outputs, such as population analysis.

- Integration with [AtomsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl) - an interface for atomic geometries.
    - By extension, provides interoperability with libraries that use AtomsBase.jl, such as [DFTK.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/DFTK.jl), [Molly.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl) and [InteratomicPotentials.jl](https://github.com/cesmix-mit/InteratomicPotentials.jl).
- Integration with [Fermi.jl](https://github.com/FermiQC/Fermi.jl) - quantum chemistry framework written in Julia.


## Installation (Julia â‰¥ 1.9 Recommended)
In the Julia REPL
```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add("Cclib")
```
